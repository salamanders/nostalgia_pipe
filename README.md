# NostalgiaPipe

### **Your Memories, Reimagined for the AI Era.**

**Stop guessing what `VTS_01_1.VOB` contains.**
NostalgiaPipe is the intelligent archival assistant that watches your home movies so it can name them for you. It bridges the gap between raw DVD backups and a modern, searchable Google Photos library.

## **Why NostalgiaPipe?**

Most DVD rippers leave you with cryptic filenames and jagged, interlaced video. NostalgiaPipe is different. It is an **all-in-one** solution designed for preservationists who want the convenience of AI.

### **✨ AI-Powered Organization**
Forget manual renaming. NostalgiaPipe extracts key frames from your videos and uses **Google Gemini AI** to "watch" the footage.
*   **Before:** `F:/Backups/2004_Xmas/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_1.VOB`
*   **After:** `2004-12-25 Christmas Morning - Kids Opening Presents.mp4`

### **🎞️ Archival-Grade Quality**
We treat your memories with the respect they deserve.
*   **Advanced Deinterlacing:** Uses "Bob Weaver" (bwdif) adaptive deinterlacing to turn old 60i DVD signals into buttery smooth 60fps progressive video.
*   **High Fidelity:** Preserves audio context and uses visually lossless compression (CRF 18+) to ensure no detail is lost.

### **🧠 Smart Filtering**
The built-in **NostalgiaFilter** and **Scanner** engines are smart enough to ignore DVD menus, copyright warnings, and corrupted artifacts, ensuring only your actual home movies make it to the cloud.

## **How It Works**

1.  **Discovery:** Point NostalgiaPipe at a hard drive containing raw `VIDEO_TS` folders. It recursively finds every DVD structure.
2.  **Analysis:** It identifies the content, snapping a high-quality reference image of the event.
3.  **Vision:** The AI analyzes the scene to generate a descriptive, sentimental title.
4.  **Preservation:** The video is transcoded, deinterlaced, and saved with rich metadata, ready for your media server or cloud library.
